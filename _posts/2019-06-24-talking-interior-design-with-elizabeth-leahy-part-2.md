<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Elizabeth Leahy joins once more to talk about the role that interior design plays in real estate.</em></p>

Today I’m joined once more by interior designer Elizabeth Leahy to talk about the role of interior design in the real estate business.&nbsp;

In the previous video ([which you can find here](https://blog.voakhomes.com/how-does-interior-design-play-a-role-in-the-real-estate-business.html){: target="_blank"}), we talked a little about what type of services she provides, how interior design helps homeowners, and what common mistakes builders and homeowners commonly make when it comes to interior design.&nbsp;

This time, we’ll dive deeper into the finer points of interior design. **Once again, here’s an outline of our conversation, with timestamps so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you most:**

0:40—The two immutable truths of interior design: proportion and scale&nbsp;<br>2:04—Which current trends are long-lasting and which aren’t?&nbsp;<br>3:08—What’s the best material for countertops?<br>4:41—The difference between quartz and quartzite&nbsp;<br>6:41—Elizabeth’s recommendations for those looking to upgrade their flooring<br>7:41—The cost of luxury vinyl tile compared to regular hardwood<br>8:25—What does it cost to hire someone like Elizabeth?<br>9:50—Wrapping things up&nbsp;

If you’d like to reach out to Elizabeth about a project, send her an email to [elizabeth@leahyinteriordesign.com](mailto:elizabeth@leahyinteriordesign.com), visit her [website](https://leahyinteriordesign.com/){: target="_blank"}, or give her a call at (858) 229-2861.

If you have any other real estate-related questions for me in the meantime, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
