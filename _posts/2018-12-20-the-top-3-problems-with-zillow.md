<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Zillow can be a valuable tool, but it definitely isn’t a perfect resource. Today we’ll be covering the top three problems people encounter when using this popular real estate website.</em></p>

Most of the people I’ve met have a love/hate relationship with Zillow. While this popular real estate website can be a valuable tool, many of its features are deeply flawed.

Today, we’ll review three of the most common problems people encounter when using Zillow:

**1. Inaccurate home values.** 13% of all Zillow Zestimates are off by more than 10%. This could mean a difference of tens of thousands of dollars for Zillow’s higher-end listings. The reason for this discrepancy is that Zillow’s algorithm cannot account for certain key features of a home, like its location or how recently it has been updated. The information on Zillow is no replacement for what an experienced agent can tell you.

**2. Outdated information.** Buyers using Zillow will often find a listing they love only to find out later from their agent that this property sold months ago. Much of the data you’ll find on Zillow is old, and should be taken with a grain of salt.

**3. Misleading advertising for “Coming Soon” listings.** People get excited about these supposedly exclusive properties when they see them online, but often fail to account for the fact that this arrangement will require them to work directly with the listing agent representing it. Some might assume that forgoing representation of their own is worthwhile, but this is seldom the case.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
