<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A pre-inspection means you’ll know what’s wrong before buyers do. From there, you can save a lot of time and money by fixing things yourself.</em></p>

Before you decide to sell your home, there are a few reasons why you should consider getting a pre-inspection.&nbsp;

**Primarily, a pre-inspection helps you know what you’re dealing with when you get into escrow.** By knowing this, you’ll be able to handle things up front. Many buyers come with a long list of repairs or ask for a large credit after getting an inspection, which can take sellers off guard and derail a transaction.

**If you know what repairs are needed ahead of time, you can do some of them yourself.** In San Diego, for example, we get a lot of calcified angle stops due to hard water. This is something a handy homeowner can easily fix on their own. Otherwise, buyers will usually request a licensed plumber—that’s a big, big expense.

Though some agents don’t recommend pre-inspections, having one can save you a lot of money down the road. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
