<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Welcome back to another of my neighborhood expert interviews! In today’s episode, I sit down with Skip Keeley from Alert 360 to discuss home security.</em></p>

Skip Keeley of Alert 360 was originally recommended to me by a client when I was asking for tips on the best companies to use for smart home technology and home security. I hired him to install a system in my own home, and I was extremely impressed and surprised about how little I know about not just home security, but also about smart home technology.

Realizing that, I’ve asked him to join me for an overview of the latest trends, tips, and tricks in the smart home/ security industry.
